Introduction
it focuses on the exploration and application of optimization techniques used in training machine learning models. The primary goal of Task 4 is to understand how optimizers influence model performance, convergence speed, and overall accuracy. Through comparative experimentation using different optimization algorithms, the task demonstrates how subtle changes in model training logic can yield significant improvements in results.

1. Objectives and Scope
The key objectives of this task include:

Model Setup: Construction of a simple neural network for classification using the MNIST dataset.

Optimizer Comparison: Implementation and evaluation of multiple optimization techniques.

Performance Analysis: Monitoring accuracy, loss curves, and convergence behavior for each optimizer.

Conclusion Drawing: Identifying which optimizer delivers the best performance under the same conditions.

The task offers insights into model tuning practices that are essential in applied machine learning, particularly in deep learning workflows.

2. Tools and Environment

Programming Language: Python 3.8

Development Platform: Jupyter Notebook

Framework: TensorFlow 2.x and Keras (for deep learning model creation and training)

Dataset Used: MNIST handwritten digits dataset (provided within keras.datasets)

Visualization: Matplotlib for loss and accuracy plots

This setup enables efficient experimentation with minimal resource requirements and is suitable for both local and cloud-based environments.

3. Workflow and Methodology

Dataset Preparation
The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0–9), was loaded. Input features (images) were normalized by dividing pixel values by 255, converting them from a range of 0–255 to 0–1. The labels were used as categorical integers, aligning with sparse categorical crossentropy loss.

Model Architecture
A sequential neural network was constructed using Keras. The model consisted of:

A Flatten layer to convert 28×28 input into a 1D array

Two Dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation

One output Dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation for multi-class classification

Optimizers Implemented
Four optimizers were used to train the same model structure:

SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent): A basic optimizer using fixed learning rates.

Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation): Combines momentum and RMSprop for faster convergence.

RMSprop: Adjusts learning rates based on recent gradient magnitudes.

Adagrad: Modifies learning rates based on the frequency of updates, making rare parameters receive more attention.

Each model was compiled with the selected optimizer, sparse categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

Training and Evaluation
Each optimizer was tested by training the model for a fixed number of epochs (e.g., 10), using identical batch sizes and training parameters.
Training and validation accuracy/loss were plotted using Matplotlib to visually compare how quickly and effectively each optimizer converged.

Results Comparison
Among the tested optimizers, Adam generally yielded the fastest convergence and the highest accuracy on both training and validation sets. SGD, while consistent, converged slower and occasionally underperformed. RMSprop showed strong performance, particularly on noisy data.
The results indicate that optimizer choice significantly impacts training dynamics and should be considered a crucial hyperparameter.

4. Real-World Use Cases

Deep Learning in Healthcare: Adam and RMSprop are often preferred for training CNNs in medical image analysis due to their fast convergence and adaptability.

Natural Language Processing: In large-scale NLP models, optimizers like Adam are favored for managing complex gradient behaviors across many layers.

Financial Forecasting Models: SGD may still be used for simpler or batch-processed datasets, where overfitting is less of a concern.

Understanding which optimization technique works best in specific scenarios is key to building efficient and high-performing models.

5. Conclusion
This task highlights the critical role of optimization algorithms in machine learning. By implementing and comparing multiple optimizers under the same model architecture and data conditions, clear differences were observed in learning efficiency and model accuracy. Among the tested methods, Adam offered a strong balance between speed and performance. The task reinforces that thoughtful selection and tuning of optimizers can lead to significant gains in model performance and stability, particularly in deep learning environments.
